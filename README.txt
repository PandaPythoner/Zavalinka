Hi, it's our app for playing zavalinka game!


If you want to run it on your own, you should:
    1. Run configure.py (it will create some important folders/files that are in gitignore)
    2. Run 'python manage.py makemigrations zavalinka_game' and 'python manage.py migrate'
    3. Add some words to ZavalinkaWord database table (now you can do it only in admin webpage)

Yeah, now you can play!
